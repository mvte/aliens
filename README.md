# Aliens
Probabilistic decision making in adverse environments. \
By Jan Marzan

## Abstract
This project investigates probabilistic decision-making strategies for an autonomous agent tasked with rescuing crew members while avoiding aliens in a hostile environment.  The agent operates within a simulated spaceship and utilizes both probabilistic and deterministic sensor data to make informed decisions about navigation and rescue operations. Three scenarios of increasing complexity are explored: one alien and one crew member, one alien and two crew members, and two aliens and two crew members. For each scenario, different bot strategies are developed and compared, focusing on their ability to update and use their beliefs about the locations of the crew members based on sensor information, and to make decisions that balance the goals of rescue and survival. The performance of the bot strategies is evaluated through simulations, considering metrics such as the average number of moves required to rescue all crew members, the probability of success, and the average number of crew members saved. This project provides valuable insights into the design and implementation of probabilistic decision-making strategies for autonomous agents operating in uncertain, multi-agent environments.
