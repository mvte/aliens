'''
Bot 2 uses a utilitarian approach towards finding the crewmate. That is, at any point, the bot will move to the cell within some 
local search depth that has the highest utility. The utility of a cell is defined as the sum of the following:
1. The probability that the crewmate is in the cell multiplied by the crewmate utility
2. The probability that the alien is in the cell multiplied by the alien utility
3. A penalty for cells that have been explored
4. A reward for cells that have not been explored
