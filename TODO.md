- send bot beeps and sensor alerts per step (done)
- finish implementation logic of bot 1 (done)
    - use insights from class about temporal models and belief to find probability maps
    - update crewmate pbb (done)
    - update alien pbb (done)
- complete bot2 (done)
    - local search + utility
    - instead of nearest adjacent nodes, consider a set radius
    - add preference for unexplored nodes, to encourage exploration
- show probability maps for bots in visualization (another heatmap) (done)
- refactor so that the ship consists only of open or closed nodes (done)
    - treat alien in the same way we treat the crewmember and the bot
- test suite (done)
    - for each bot per comparison: 10 layouts x 10 different starting positions x 10 simulations
    - i.e. each layout has 10 different starting positions that we run 10 times for each bot
- save data on finish
    - average number of moves to rescue all crew members
    - probability of successfully avoiding the alien and rescuing the crew (failure/success rate)
    - average number of crew members saved
