- send bot beeps and sensor alerts per step (done)
- finish implementation logic of bot 1
    - use insights from class about temporal models and belief to find probability maps
    - maybe consider a state based approach to the bot
        - data collection (listen for beeps from various locations, consider "anchoring" to certain parts of the board)
        - alien detected (evade)
        - goto crewmate (high confidence in crewmate's position)
- show probability maps for bots in visualization (another heatmap)
